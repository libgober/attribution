New York brought action seeking a judgment declaring that during the preceding ten years specified counties did not use State\rquote s voting qualifications \u8216\'3ffor the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color\u8217\'3f and that Voting Rights Act sections designed to prohibit use of test or device for the alteration of voting qualifications or procedures when purpose or effect is to deprive a citizen of his right to vote were thus inapplicable to such counties. Three-Judge District Court for the District of Columbia denied a motion to intervene and granted summary judgment for New York, and unsuccessful intervenors appealed. The Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Blackmun, held that the words \u8216\'3fany appeal,\u8217\'3f within Voting Rights Act section relating to action by State or political subdivision for declaratory judgment as to absence of denial or abridgment of voting rights on account of race or color and providing that action shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges and appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court, encompass appeal by a would-be, but unsuccessful, intervenor, but that the subject motion to intervene was untimely, and the District Court, did not, in light of such fact and other circumstances of case, abuse its discretion in denying the motion.

Sections 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, are designed to prohibit the use of tests or devices, or the alteration of voting qualifications or procedures, when the purpose or effect is to deprive a citizen of his right to vote. Sections 4 and 5 apply in any State or political subdivision thereof which the Attorney General determines maintained on November 1, 1964, or November 1, 1968, any \u8216\'3ftest or device,\u8217\'3f and with respect to which the Director of the Census Bureau determines that less than half the voting-age residents were registered, or that less than half voted in the presidential election of that November. These determinations are effective on publication and are not judicially reviewable. Publication suspends the effectiveness of the test or device, which may not then be utilized unless a three-judge District Court for the District of Columbia determines that no

 such test or device has been used during the 10 preceding years \u8216\'3ffor the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.\u8217\'3f The section provides for direct appeal to the Supreme Court. The State or political subdivision may also institute an action pursuant to s 5 in the District Court for the District of Columbia, for a declaratory judgment that a proposed alteration in voting qualifications or procedures \u8216\'3fdoes not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.\u8217\'3f The statute also permits the change to be enforced without the court proceeding if it has been submitted to the Attorney General and he has not interposed an objection within 60 days. Neither the Attorney General\rquote s failure to object nor a s 5 declaratory judgment bars a subsequent private action to enjoin enforcement of the change.

 Court. The Attorney General, on July 31, 1970, filed with the Federal Register his determination that New York on November 1, 1968, maintained a test or device as defined in the Act, and this was published the next day. On March 27, 1971, the Federal Register published the Census Director\rquote s determination that in the counties of Bronx, Kings, and New York, \u8216\'3fless than 50 per centum of the persons of voting age residing therein voted in the presidential election of November 1968.\u8217\'3f New York State filed an action on December 3, 1971, seeking a judgment declaring that during the preceding 10 years the three counties had not used the State\rquote s voting qualifications \u8216\'3ffor the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color\u8217\'3f and that ss 4 and 5 were thus inapplicable to the counties. Pursuant to stipulation, the United States filed its answer on March 10, 1972, alleging, inter alia, that it was without knowledge or information to form a belief as to the truth of New York\rquote s allegation that the literacy tests were not administered discriminatorily. On March 17, New York filed a motion for summary judgment, supported by affidavits, and on April 3 the United States formally consented to the entry of the declaratory judgment sought by the State. Appellants filed their motion to intervene on April 7. New York opposed the motion claiming that: it was untimely, as the suit had been pending for more than four months; it had been publicized in early February, and appellants did not deny that they knew the action was pending; appellants failed to allege appropriate supporting facts; no appellant claimed to be a victim of voting discrimination; appellants\rquote  interests were adequately represented by the United States; delay would prejudice impending elections; and appellants still could raise discrimination issues in the state and federal courts of New York. On April 13 the three-judge court denied the motion to intervene and granted summary judgment for New York. While the appeal was pending, it was disclosed that the attorney who executed affidavits for appellants had not begun employment with appellant NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund, Inc., until March 9, 1972, and that Justice Department attorneys met with two individual appellants in January 1972 during the course of their investigation.

Although the Director of the Bureau of the Census determined, on March 15, 1971, that less than 50% of the persons of voting age residing in the three named New York counties voted in the presidential election of November 1968, it was stated on behalf of the appellees in oral argument that a complete set of census statistics was not available to the State of New York until October 15, 1971. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. The appellants, however, in the complaint filed by them in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in their s 5 suit against the New York City Board of Elections and others, No. 72 Civ. 1460, alleged that census information on which reapportionment was based was made available to the State no later than September 1, 1971. App. 59a. We do not know which of these dates is correct. It is clear, in any event, that census data for the redrawing of congressional and legislative district lines was not available to New York until the fall of 1971.

Thus, it was said, the disposition of the present suit might impair or impede the appellants\rquote  ability to protect their interests in registering to vote, voting, and seeking public office. App. 46a. It was further claimed that during the preceding three weeks attorneys in the Department of Justice thrice had represented to appellants\rquote  counsel that the United States would oppose New York\rquote s motion for summary judgment.

The United States took no position with respect to the appellants\rquote  motion to intervene. New York opposed the motion on six grounds. The first was untimeliness in that the suit had been pending for more than four months, an article about it had appeared in early February in the New York Times, and the appellants did not deny that they had knowledge of the pendency of the action. The second was failure to allege appropriate supporting facts. The third was the lack of a requisite interest in that none of the appellants asserted he was a victim of discriminatory application of the literacy test; rather, the motion to intervene was subordinate to the appellants\rquote  real interest in invalidating New York\rquote s reapportionment of its assembly, senate, and congressional districts, as evidenced by the institution of their action in the Southern District of New York.

 was adequate representation of the appellants\rquote  interest by the United States. The fifth was that delay in the granting of the motion for summary judgment would prejudice New York and jeopardize the impending primary elections for offices of Assembly, Senate, and Congress, as well as for delegates to the upcoming Democratic National Convention. The sixth was that the appellants and others who claimed discrimination still could raise those issues in the state and federal courts of New York.

2. We, however, need not confine our evaluation of abuse of discretion to the facts just mentioned, for the record amply demonstrates that appellants failed to protect their interest in a timely fashion after March 21, 1972, the date they allegedly were first informed of the pendency of the action. At that point, the suit was over three months old and had reached a critical stage. The United States had answered New York\rquote s complaint on March 10 and in that answer had clearly indicated that it was without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of New York\rquote s allegation that the State\rquote s literacy tests were administered without regard to race or color. App. 13a. New York, in reliance upon this answer, then filed its motion for summary judgment. The only step remaining was for the

 United States either to oppose or to consent to the entry of summary judgment. This was the status of the suit at the time the appellants concede they were aware of its existence. It was obvious that there was a strong likelihood that the United States would consent to the entry of judgment since its answer revealed that it was without information with which it could oppose the motion for summary judgment. Thus, it was incumbent upon the appellants, at that stage of the proceedings, to take immediate affirmative steps to protect their interests either by supplying the Department of Justice with any information they possessed concerning the employment of literacy tests in a way designed to deny New York citizens of the right to vote on account of race or color, or by presenting that information to the District Court itself by way of an immediate motion to intervene.

4. Finally, in view of the then rapidly approaching primary elections in New York and of the final date for filing nominating petitions to participate in those elections, the granting of a motion to intervene possessed the potential for seriously disrupting the State\rquote s electoral process with the result that primary and general elections would then have been based on population figures from the 1960 census and more than 10 years old.

The Attorney General of New York protests this statement. But the 90-year-long segregated school system of last century is not the point; the reference is to the offer of proof made by the appellants. The Attorney General also states that the federal investigation showed that the inference has no basis in fact. He asserts moreover that New York\rquote s literacy requirement has no racial cast in practice. But appellants\rquote  offer of proof is disturbing to say the least. The case was disposed of on a motion for summary judgment. The case is in my view a classic example of the inappropriateness of such a procedure. As I state in my dissent, a hearing should have been held and findings of fact made.

The Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970 were specifically aimed at New York\u8212\'3fparticularly Bronx, Kings, and New York Counties. It was pointed out in the debates that under the earlier Act these counties were not included, that while in the 1964 election more than 50% of the voters were registered and more than 50% voted, in the 1968 election 50% were not registered or voting. 116 Cong.Rec. 6654, 6659. It was pointed out that New York\rquote s literacy requirement was enacted with the view of discriminating on the basis of race., Id., at 6660. New York blacks were illiterate because their education, if any, had been in second-class schools elsewhere. Id., at 6661. It was emphasized that wherever the blacks had been educated it was unconstitutional to discriminate against them on the basis of race even though illiterate. Id., at 5533. The use of literacy tests in New York tended to deter blacks from registering, it was said. Ibid. And it was pointed out that literacy tests had a greater impact on blacks and other minorities than on any white because literacy was higher among whites. Id., at 5532\u8212\'3f5549.

. The case plainly turns on its facts, and its impact on the development of principles governing intervention will doubtless be small. But what is ultimately at stake in this suit by New York to obtain an exemption under the Voting Rights Act is the applicability of the protections of the Act to 2.2 million minority-group members residing in three New York counties. According to appellants, the total number of minority-group members affected by all previous exemptions combined was less than 100,000.

At the same time that the District Court denied the motion to intervene, it granted the State\rquote s motion for summary judgment, thereby exempting these three counties from the coverage of the Act. The United States, defendant in the suit, consented to the entry of summary judgment. As a result, the contention that appellants were prepared to urge\u8212\'3fnamely, that the grant of an exemption would nullify the specific congressional intent to extend the protections of the Act to the class represented by appellants\u8212\'3fwas never laid before the Court.

Thus, the record before the District Court indicated reasonable reliance on the Government\rquote s assurances that the suit would not be settled. And appellants did move to intervene within four days of learning that they could no longer rely on the Government to protect their interests. On that record, the District Court was obligated to conclude that the motion was timely filed. Since the allegation of untimeliness was, in my view, the only nonfrivolous objection to the motion, the District Court\rquote s denial of the motion was unquestionably erroneous. I dissent.
