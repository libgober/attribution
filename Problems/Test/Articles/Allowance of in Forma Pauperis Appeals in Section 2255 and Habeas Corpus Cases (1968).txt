ALLOWANCE OF IN FORMA PAUPERIs APPEALS IN § 2255 AND HABEAS CORPUS
CASES

On April 10, 1967, the Supreme Court of the United States decided Nowakowski
v. Maroney, 386 U.S. 542, 87 S.Ct. 1197, 18 L.Ed.2d 282 (1967). This is a
two page unanimous per curiam opinion. As you might expect from its brevity,
the opinion is direct and to the point. Nowakowski was a Pennsylvania state
prisoner. He alleged the denial of the assistance of counsel in his state criminal
trial and sought a federal writ of habeas corpus. The habeas court appointed a
lawyer for him, held a hearing, and concluded that there there had not been a
denial of his constitutional right to counsel. But the district judge issued the
certificate of probable cause which is necessary under 28 U.S.C. § 2253, for any
state prisoner to appeal a denial of federal habeas corpus.
Court-appointed counsel were then permitted to withdraw. Nowakowski petitioned
the Third Circuit to allow his appeal in forma pauperis and toappoint new
counsel for him. Both aspects of this motion were denied by the court of appeals
in a brief order without a hearing. Certiorari was granted as was leave to proceed
as a poor person. 384 U.S. 984, 86 S.Ct. 1893, 16 L.Ed.2d 1003.
The Supreme Court held that this denial by the Third Circuit was error. While
the Court recognized that "weighty consideration" should be given a district
judge's prior denial of an application for a certificate of probable cause, it ruled,
on the other hand, that when the judge issues the certificate, "the court of appeals
must grant an appeal in forma pauperis (assuming the requisite showing of poverty),
and proceed to a disposition of the appeal in accord with its ordinary
procedure."
That is all there is to Nowakowski. Once a district judge issues that certificate
of probable cause in a state prisoner's federal habeas case, he binds his appellate
court to accept the appeal, whether paid or in forma pauperis, in its ordinary
routine. When the trial court issues the certificate, the court of appeals has no
discretion to second-guess the district judge on the issue of probable cause.
The Eighth Circuit, of course, has recognized Nowakow8ki. Gross v. Bishop,
377 F.2d 492 (8 Cir. 1967).
It is this decision, I understand, which prompted your program committee to
place on the agenda of this conference the subject, "Allowances of In Forma
Pauperis Appeals in § 2255 and Habeas Corpus Cases." Does your committee
thereby possibly suggest that each district judge who is here should bear in
mind that perhaps a probable cause certificate is not necessarily to be granted
as a matter of course without some earnest considertaion of the underlying
substance of the applicant's case? Does it possibly suggest, also, that each
appellate court judge who is here bear in mind that perhaps a probable cause
certificate is not necessarily to be issued by him as a matter of course, whenever
the district judge has denied it, without some earnest consideration of the
underlying substance of the applicant's case?
We must, of course, examine the statutes. Because we are concerned with in
forma pauperis appeals, we look at four statutes in the following order: first,
28 U.S.C. § 1915, which governs proceedings and appeals in forma papueris generally; then § 2253, which has to do with habeas appeals; then§ 2255; and finally
§ 753(f), the Court Reporter Act.
I. Section 1915
A. Its general nature.
28 U.S.C. § 1915. Proceedings in forma pauperis
(a) Any court of the United States may authorize the commencement,
prosecution or defense of any suit, action or proceeding, civil or criminal,
or appeal therein, without prepayment of fees and costs. * * *
An appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies
in writing that it is not taken in good faith. * * * -
It is at once apparent that this statute is very broad in its application and
reach.
1. It is broad because it vests the power to authorize In .forma pauperis
procedure in "any court", trial or appellate. It would appear that in forma
pauperis appellate relief is not dependent upon the existence of in forma pauperis
procedure in the district court.
2. It is broad because the procedure is available at any stage of the litigation.
The statute refers to commencement, prosecution or defense, or appeal.
3. It is broad because it applies to either side of the litigation, to "prosecution
or defense".
4. It is broad because it applies to civil as well as to criminal matters.
5. It is broad in other respects. Thus, by subsection (b), if a printed record
is required by an appellate court, the court may direct the expense of even that
printing to be paid by the United States.
We therefore have a statute which is comprehensive as to court as to the
stage of the proceeding, as to prosecution or defense, as to the nature, criminal
or civil, of the litigation, and as to other monetary detail. Seemingly, it makes
available to the indigent person, in a deserving situation, the same access to the
federal court, trial or appellate, as is possessed by the paying litigant. This very
accessibility, as you know, has been emphasized again and again by the Supreme
Court.
Despite all this, the general wording of the entire statute is not mandatory
but is permissive. For the most part, it reads in terms of "may", not of "shall".
"Any court of the United States may authorize"; the court "may * * * direct";
the court "may request an attorney to represent. * * *"
Presumably because of this permissive language, there are a number of cases
in which courts of appeals have said that in forma pauperis procedure is a
privilege and not a right The District of Columbia, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth
Circuits all said so in cases decided before 1957. Dorsey v. Gill, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 9,
148 F.2d 857, 877 (1945), cert. denied 325 U.S. 890, 65 S.Ct. 1580, 89 L.Ed. 2003;
Parsell v. United States, 218 F.2d 232, 235 (5 Cir. 1955) ; Barkeij v. Ford Motor
Co., 230 F.2d 729, 731 (9 Oir. 1956) ; Clough v. Hunter, 191 F.2d 516, 518
(10 Cir. 1951).
This privilege characterization, for the most part, antedates Johnson v. United
States, 352 U.S. 565, 77 S.Ct. 550, 1 LEd2d 593, decided March 4, 1957. The
Supreme Court there held (1) that the district Judge's certification that the
appeal is not taken in good faith "is not final in the sense that the convicted
defendant is barred from showing that it was unwarranted"; (2) that the trial
judge's certificate "carries great weight but, necessarily, it cannot be conclusive";
(3) that "Upon a proper showing a Court of Appeals has a duty to displace a Dis
trict Court's certification"; (4) that the defendant or his assigned counsel "must
be enabled to show that the grounds for seeking an appeal * * * are not frivolous
and do not justify the finding that the appeal is not sought in good faith"; and
(5) that it is essential that the defendant be assured some appropriate means,
such as the court's notes, or an agreed statement by trial counsel, for showing
the basis of his claim that the court committed error in the certificate. This holding
would seem to cast a clear and definite shadow on any rigid concept that in
forma pauperis procedure is a privilege and not a right. 0
Nevertheless. even since the 1957 decision in Johnson, courts of appeals on
occasion have still characterized the procedure as an privilege. Gomez v. United
States. 245 F.2d 346, 347 (5 Cir. 1957) : Weller v. Dickson, 314 F.2d 598. 600 (9
Cir. 1963), cert. denied 375 U.S. 845, 84 S. Ct. 97, 11 L.Ed.2d 72: Smart v. Heinze,
347 F.2d 114, 116 (9 Cir. 1965), cert. denied 382 U.S. 896, 86 S.Ct. 192, 15 L.Ed.2d
153; Moore v. Taylor. 289 F.2d 450 (10 Cir. 1961), cert. denied 368 U.S. 853, 82
S.Ct. 90, 7 L.Ed.2d 102.

The Eighth Circuit, too, has described in forma pauperis procedure as "entirely
statutory" and as a privilege and not a right. This was done in 1950 in an opinion
by Judge Dewey, Willis v. Utecht, 185 F.2d 210, 212 (8 Cir. 1950), cert, denied 340
U.S. 915, 71 S.Ct. 286, 95 L.Ed 651, and in 1952 in an opinion by Judge Sanborn,
Higgins v. Steele, 195 F.2d 366, 368 (8 Cir. 1952). Later, however, in 1958, the
court, in a per curiam opinion, obviously written by Judge Sanborn, specifically
questioned this. Weber v. United States, 254 F.2d 713, 714-715 (8 Cir. 1958).
B. The standards of § 1915(a).
A reading of the statute reveals immediately that it projects two standards. The
first is in § 1915(a), which provides that an appeal may not be taken in forma
pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken "in good faith".
The second is in § 1915(d), which provides that the court may dismiss the case
if it "is satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious".
Are these two standards identical? What does good faith mean? Does absence
of good faith equate with frivolity or maliciousness? Does § 1915(d) apply only
to the district court and not at all to the appellate court? Does the double feature
of the statute suggest that a trial court should only rarely certify that an appeal
is not taken in good faith because the appeal is subject to dismissal anyway by
the appellate court?
Five Supreme Court cases decided in the last decade provide answers or indications
of answers to some of these questions which so obviously arise upon a
cursory reading of § 1915. The cases are Johnson v. United States, 352 U.S. 565. 77
S.Ct. 550, 1 L.Ed.2d 593 (1957), which has already been referred to; Farley v.
United States, 354 U.S. 521. 77 S.Ct. 1371. 1 L.Ed.2d 1529 (1957) ; Ellis v. United
States, 356 U.S. 674, 78 S.Ct. 974, 2 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1958) ; Coppedge v. United
States, 369 U.S. 438, 82 S.Ct. 917, 8 L.Ed.2d 21 (1962); and Hardy v. United
States, 375 U.S. 277, 84 S.Ot. 424, 11 L.Ed.2d 331 (1964). Not all of these were
unanimous and there are significant observations in concurrence as well as in dissent.
All five were direct appeals from federal criminal convictions.
We do not have the time here carefully to analyze these five opinions. One
may fairly say, however, that these cases clearly disclose the attitude of the
Supreme Court toward the in forma pauperis § 1915. The impoverished applicant
is to be afforded procedural protection equating with that possessed by the
more affluent applicant. If counsel is requested and provided, as now required
on direct appeals, that representation must be truly adequate, that is, counsel
must be an advocate and not merely an amicus. And, if a record is necessary, an
adequate record, even, in certain situations, a complete record, must be provided.
"Good faith" in the statute is the presentation of any issue "not plainly frivolous".
No particular degree of merit or probability of success need be shown. Good faith
is to be measured by an objective, not a subjective, standard. Equal treatment
is emphasized. The government has the burden. The possibility of a rational argument
on either the law or the facts is enough. In other words, doubt is to be
resolved in favor of the applicant. Looking at it from another point of view,
one may appropriately say that the in forma pauperis appeal is not to be denied
simply because the trial judge is of the opinion that the appeal has no merit.
The test is not whether the appeal has merit but whether there is an issue which
is not plainly frivolous in the situation. Page v. United States, 272 F.2d 816 (8
Cir. 1959), or whether the applicant can make some rational argument. Naturally,
the application of this standard is not always easy.
One may, of course, argue that these five Supreme Court opinions pronounce
rules applicable only to direct criminal appeals. Are these same rules and the
reasoning which produces them equally applicable as a general proposition
to in forma pauperis appeals in civil cases and in habeas corpus and § 2255
appeals, both of which are civil in nature, even though they attempt to overcome
criminal convictions? See, for example, Baker v. United States, 334 F.2d
444, 447 (8 Cir. 1964).
One finds, first of all, that there are civil damage cases where the courts
say the same in forma pauperis standards are applicable. Thus, in John v. Gibson,
270 F.2d 36 (9 Cir. 1959), cert. denied 361 U.S. 970, 80 S.Ct. 601, 4 L.Ed.2d
549, the court held that the test to be applied is that stated in Ellis, but that
the appeal may be dismissed if it would also be dismissed in the case of a nonindigent
litigant. This Ninth Circuit view, however, finds one dissenter from it
on the present court, for Judge Duniway, concurring in Weller v. Dickson,
supra, p. 603 of 314 F.2d, states that the rules may not be the same in civil cases.
The Eighth Circuit touched upon this question in Cohen v. Curtis Publishing
Co., 333 F.2d 974, 978-979 (8 Cir. 1964), cert. denied 380 U.S. 921, 85 S.Ct. 923,
13 L.Ed.2d 808. In that private antitrust action the district court denied the
plaintiff's motion for leave to appeal in forma pauperis and certified that the
appeal was not taken in good faith. The defendants, pursuant to then civil Rule
75(j) [now, essentially, Rule 75(g)], moved to docket and dismiss. The Eighth
Circuit granted that motion although it recognized that a motion to dismiss
on grounds of frivolity or lack of good faith "should be granted only in extreme
cases". Our court made no reference to the In forma pauperis standards enunciated
In the direct criminal appeal cases. The Ninth Circuit has a similar recent
case where relief was afforded in civil rights litigation but wthout menton of
the direct criminal appeal standards. Stiltner v. Rhay, 322 F.2d 314 (9 Cir.
1963), cert. denied Stiltner v. Washington, 376 U.S. 920, 84 S.Ct. 678, 11
L.Ed.2d. 615.
In federal habeas cases one finds similar comment. The Tenth Circuit has
flatly held, in cases concerning in forma pauperis procedure generally (and
not the specific Issues of appointment of counsel, cost-free record, and the like),
that the standards enunciated in the cases involving direct criminal appeals are
to be applied to habeas matters. The primary case is Ragan v. Cox, 305 F.2d 58
(10 Cir. 1962). There the court cited both Ellie and Coppedge and acknowledged
that those decisions were direct appeals. Nevertheless, the standards were applied.
In addition, the court stated that the phraseology difference between the provisions
for appeal in § 1915 (a), that is, "not taken in good faith," and the provision
for dismissal in § 1915(d), that is, "frivolous or malicious," are "not
material." I am not sure that this last observation was essential for the decision
but its presence is of interest. Another Tenth Circuit case is Tidmore v. Taylor,
323 F.2d 88, 90 (10 Cir. 1963).
The Ninth Circuit, in habeas matters, has cited the Tenth Circuit cases and
has used the Supreme Court phraseology specifically. "It is frivolous only if
the applicant can make no rational argument on the law or facts in support of
his claim for relief." Blair v. People of State of California, 340 F.2d 741, 742
(9 Cir. 1965) ; Pembrook v. Wilson, 370 F.2d 37, 39 (9 Cir. 1966).
Parenthetically we may note here that some of these cases make the observation
that the proper procedure in the district court is to grant the petition to proceed
in forma pauperis and then, if it appears that the matter is frivolous, to dismiss
under § 1915(d). This statement has been made in a federal habeas case,
Oughton v. United States, 310 F. 2d 803, 804 (10 Cir. 1962), cert. denied 373 U.S.
937, 835. Ct. 1542, 10 L. Ed. 2d 693; in a civil action, Stiltner v. Rhay, supra, 322
F. 2d 314, 317 (9 Cir. 1963) ; Cole v. Smith, 344 F. 2d 721, 723 (8 Cir. 1965) ; and
in a § 2255 proceeding, Foster v. United States, 344 F. 2d 698, 699 (6 Oir. 1965).
I have seen no statement to this effect regarding appellate procedure.
There are, however, intimations that limits do exist and that not everything
guaranteed by the five cited Supreme Court cases is applicable on the civil side.
The lower federal courts, on occasion, seem purposely to observe and suggest that
there is a difference between a criminal case and a civil one. Thus, in King v.
Carmichael, 268 F. 2d 305, 306 (6 0ir. 1959), cert. denied 361 U.S. 968, 80 5. Ct.
597, 4 L. Ed. 2d 548, a civil rights case, the court, in considering the issue of a free
transcript, said, '"This is not a criminal case," and that the information sought
was otherwise available. In Anderson v. Heinze, 258 F. 2d 479, 481 (9 Cir. 1958),
cert. denied 358 U.S. 889, 79 S. Ct. 131, 3 L. Ed. 2d 116, a federal habeas proceeding
by a state prisoner, the court observed, in passing upon the issue of right to
counsel, that the appeal "is not a step in a federal criminal proceeding, but is a
step in a federal civil proceeding," and held that the Sixth Amendment has no
application and that the rule of the Johnson case was not controlling. The court
went on, however, meticulously to consider the issue in the light, instead, of the
due process clause. In a series of four § 2255 cases, the Eighth Circuit has drawn
the same distinction between criminal and civil and has observed, "Surely, no
court is required to grant leave to a defendant to appeal in forma pauperis where
It is obvious that this appeal is doomed to futility." Gershon v. United States, 243
F. 2d 527, 530 (8 Cir. 1957), cert. denied 355 U.S. 873, 78 S. CL 124, 2 L. Ed. 2d 78;
Hill v. 'Settle, 244 F. 2d 311, 312 (8 Cir. 1957) ; Young v. United -States, 246 F. 2d
901, 902 (8 Cir. 1957), cert. denied 355 U.S. 917, 78 S. Ct. 348, 2 L. Ed. 2d 277,
where it refused a cost-free record "in cases which are without merit and doomed
from their inception"; Taylor v. United States, 308 F. 2d 776, 779 (8 Cir. 1962).
These four cases were requests for in forma pauperis procedure generally but
Young Involved, as well, a specific request for a free record.
The First Circuit similarly has flatly held that the requirement of Coppedge
that counsel be appointed in a direct criminal appeal does not apply in a § 2255
case. Fleming v. United States, 365 F. 2d 587, 588, footnote (1 Cir. 1966). This
was inherent in earlier First Circuit § 2255 cases, Joyce v. United States, 327
F. 2d 531 (1 Cir. 1964) ; Suarez v. United States, 328 F. 2d 473, 474 (1 (ir. 1964),
and in a case of questionable ancestry, Keenan v. McGrath, 328 F. 2d 610, 611
(1 Cir. 1964), even though these cases did not make specific reference to Coppedge
or its companions.
Thus, one can find clear expressions in the cases that the in forma pauperis
standards which the Supreme Court has evolved for direct criminal appeals, do
have positive application to pure civil cases and to the hybrid habeas and § 2255
proceedings, but one can also find clear expressions to the effect that there is a
significant distinction between a criminal case and a civil one and that these
direct appeal standards are not fully applicable to civil proceedings.
I suspect that this difference is more apparent than real. I believe that on
analysis-which in the long run may or may not prove sound-the free expressions
of full application on the civil side have appeared in those cases in which
the applicant merely seeks in forma pauperis relief generally. Presumably, he
already has counsel or is willing to be his own counsel and presumably there is no
burning question about a transcript. It is in cases where a specific request for appointed
counsel is made, or where there is a request for a transcript at government
expense, that the courts have been hesitant. As is so often the case, it is
easier to be free with announcement of basic principles and their application
where relief flows easily; it is harder to be that free when a lawyer's time, without
compensation, or government costs are consequences. Perhaps the Eighth Circuit
cases are not so easily separated into the two categories.
One day the Supreme Court will tell us whether the direct appeal requirements
do have full application on the civil side. In the meantime, the Eighth Circuit, and
certainly the First, and perhaps the Ninth, have stopped short of unlimited application.
Thus far, the process has been a selective one. So far as I can tell, this
has not resulted in injustice.
So much for § 1915, the general in forma pauperis statute.
II. Habeas corpus.
The great writ, of course, is guaranteed by the Constitution, Article I, § 9,
clause 2, and in federal courts by Chapter 153 of the present judicial code, 28
U.S.C. H§ 2241-2255. But, as you know, § 2255, by its terms, severely limits the
availability of the writ for federal prisoners. If a federal prisoner has a remedy
under § 2255, that is the route he must follow. Weber v. Settle, 185 F.2d 799, 800
(8 Cir. 1950) Smith v. Settle, 302 F. 2d 142 (8 Cir. 1962) ; Haynes v. Harris, 344
F.2d 463, 466 (8 Cir. 1965); Cagle v. Ciccone, 368 F.2d 183, 184 (8 Cir. 1966). As
a practical consequence, therefore, federal habeas corpus is important for us
primarily with respect to state prisoners. It reads:
28 U.S.C. § 2253. Appeal
In a habeas corpus proceeding before a circuit or district judge, the final
order shall be subject to review, on appeal. * * *
An appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in
a habeas corpus proceeding where the detention complained of arises out
of process issued by a State court, unless the justice or judge who rendered
the order or a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of probable cause.
Here, we obviously have a standard. But is is a standard of probable cause.
And a certificate of probable cause is a requisite to an appeal. Madison v. Tahash,
359 F.2d 60, 61 (8 Cir. 1966); Curtis v. Bennett, 351 F.2d 931, 933 (8 Cir. 1965).
One should initially observe that this probable cause requirement of § 2253
at least does not have the equal protection difficulties which -have emerged as
to paupers' appeals in general. The probable cause certificate of § 2253 is
required of both the indigent and the nonindigent.
One may initially observe, also, that Nowakowski did not go so far as to say
that a certificate of probable cause should be routinely issued in all cases. It
merely held that when the district court issued the certificate the appellate court
must indulge in a full review. Nowakowski leaves open the basic question of
issuance or nonissuance. If any case were to hold that a certificate should
routinely issue, we could all agree that the appellate paragraph of § 2253 would
thereby be reduced to nothing more than a procedural formality, and a rather
useless one at that.
But what is probable cause? Does is equate with the standards of "good faith"
and "frivolous or malicious," which are present in § 1915?
As is perhaps to be expected, one finds varying expressions in the cases. Some
seem to -apply an interpretation of "without merit, and therefore, frivolous."
Nolan v. Nash, 316 F.2d 776 (8 Cir. 1963), cert. denied 375 U.S. 924, 84 S.Ot. 269,
11 L.Ed.2d 166; Nally v. Scott, 114 F.2d 562 (8 Cir. 1940) ; Simpson v. Teets, 248
F.2d 465, 466 (9 Cir. 1957); Tate v. United States, 123 U.S.App. D.C. 261,359
F.2d 245, 250 (1966). In other decisions probable cause seems to be related to
a lack of substance. Chessman v. Dickson, 275 F.2d 604, 606 (9 Cir. 1960) ("any
substance at all") ; Gay v. Graham, 269 F.2d 482, 487 (10 Cir. 1959) ("no
substantial question") ; United States ex rel. Stewart v. Ragen, 231 F.2d 312, 313
(7 Cir. 1956) ("some substantial question worthy of consideration") ; ex parte
Farrell, 189 F.2d 540, 543 (1 Cir. 1951), cert. denied Farrell v. O'Brien, 342 U.S.
839, 72 S.Ct. 64, 96 L.Ed. 634 ("unsubstantial, or clearly without merit");
Knuppe v. Lainson, 146 F.Supp. 731, 733 (S.D. Iowa 1956) ("substantial question
for review"). In a recent district court decision, this distinction was emphasized;
it was there noted that the statute does not define probable cause but
that, generally, this is "something more than a frivolous assertion * * * but
something less than the imperatives of 28 U.S.C. § 1292," which, as you recall,
in subsection (b), provides for an interlocutory appeal on a certificate as to
"substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal
from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation."
United States ex rel. Rivera v. Reeves, 246 F.Supp. 599, 601 (S.D.N.Y.
1965).
If there is a difference in these expressions I suspect that it is of no significance.
In most of these cases relief is denied. Certainly, if a matter is frivolous, it is
clearly without probable cause. Thus, the cases which speak of frivolity, such as
those from our own circuit, would arrive at the same conclusion on a more substantive
standard.
My own reaction is that the cases, taken as a whole, do indicate that the standard
of probable cause requires something more than the absence of frivolity and
that the standard is a higher one than the "good faith" requirement of § 1915.
Undoubtedly, this conclusion is not shared in all quarters. Yet, the decision in
No'wakowski itself, I think, suggests that this is inherently so when it requires full
dress treatment by the court of appeals once the district court has issued a certificate
of probable cause.
All this adds up, in my mind, to the conclusions that there is something definitely
to be gained by having the district court, in the first instance, give very careful
consideration to the question whether the state prisoner federal habeas applicant
has something of substance going for him, and that there is something deflnitely
to be lost when the district court routinely issues a certificate of probable
cause without this careful consideration. If the case is legally frivolous the application
ought to be denied. When the case then comes to the court of appeals, as
it inevitably does, that court will take another look at it and, on occasion, might
issue the certificate itself. The court, however, under Nowakowaki, does not have
this discretion if the district court has issued the certificate. If an appellate
judge issues the certificate where a district judge has denied it, that should not
be regarded by the district judge as a rebuff. It does mean that the appellate
judge entertains some doubt. That is his problem.
All this, after all, takes us right back to the philosophy that this, as with all
other matters, is an issue for decision by the court of general jurisdiction, the
district judge, in the first instance. This, I think, for reasons which are obvious
to all of us, is where the best considered and important decision is to be made.
This is the normal situation, for the routine case the district judge is there to
decide and not to bypass the responsibility of decision. This is the dignified thing
for him to do. This is the approach, I submit, which for so long was so forcefully
presented and believed in by Judges Sanborn and Gardner and others of the Eighth
Circuit. In Higgins v. Steele, supra, 195 F.2d 366, 369, a federal prisoner habeas
corpus case decided in 1952, a long time ago so far as this area of the criminal
law is concerned, Judge John B. Sanborn said:
"Although no district judge likes to pass upon the correctness of his own
decisions, it is his duty, if he is thoroughly convinced that there is no substantial
question for review and that an appeal will be futile, to certify that the appeal
sought to be taken in forma pauperis is not taken in good faith * * * We say this
not to relieve ourselves of the burden of reviewing cases which have no merit,
buit to relieve those who are required to resist such appeals of unnecessary trouble
and expense.
"We realize that the serious consideration which this Court has given to
appeals in forma pauperis in hopeless cases may have led the District Judges
in this Circuit to believe that such appeals should be allowed with extreme
liberality. We are now of the opinion that much greater care should be taken
in screening such cases, in order to separate those which are clearly without
merit from those which are meritorious or which at least present some substantial
question worthy of consideration."
One might ask whether a district court could, with logic, allow an appeal to
be taken in forma pauperis and yet refuse to issue a certificate of probable
cause and, if so, with what result. One might say that this partial granting and
partial denial is inconsistent. Yet, allowing in forma pauperis procedure may
indicate only that the court finds the applicant is indigent and is acting in good
faith. This may not be inconsistent with a determination of lack of probable
cause.
III. Section 2255.
Here, as you know, the statute, so far as appeals are concerned, reads:
§ 2255. Federal custody; remedies on motion attacking sentence
* * * * * * *
An appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered
on the motion as from a final judgment as application for a writ of habeas
corpus. * * *
On its face, therefore, § 2255 refers us back to the habeas corpus situation.
However, since the petitioner is not complaining of detention arising out of
process issued by a state court, the probable cause requirement of the habeas
statute § 2253 has no application. Thus for the in forma pauperis § 2255 appeal,
the only limitation is that of § 1915 centering in "good faith". All that we have
said before as to this statute presumably applies here.
Thus, if there is a distinction between "probable cause" (§ 2253) and "good
faith" (§ 1915), a § 2255 matter rests on the lower standard of mere good faith.
The Eighth Circuit, contrary perhaps to the impression of some of you, does
not routinely override, in a § 2255 case, a district court's certificate that an
appeal is not taken in good faith. See Taylor v. United States, 308 F.2d 776
(8 Cir. 1962) ; Franano v. United States, 303 F.2d 470 (8 Cir. 1962), cert denied
371 U.S. 865, 83 S.Ct. 125, 9 L.Ed.2d 102; Turner v. United States, 325 F.2d 988
(8 Cir. 1964), cert denied 377 U.S. 946, 84 S.Ct. 1354, 12 L.Ed.2d 308; Peckham v.
United States (August 1967) (unreported). Franano, incidentally, was a paid
appeal and yet was dismissed on the ground of frivolity. And Turner paid his
docket fee because he felt he might thereby avoid a denial for frivolity; he was
unsuccessful. Even in a recent direct appeal, despite the holding in Coppedge,
Chief Judge Vogel and I, presently constituting what we call the administrative
panel, recently denied in forma pauperis procedure in Misc. No. 476, Bishop v.
United States, where the complaint was a general and non-specific one directed
to claimed instructional error.
There is a recent First Circuit case which may be of some interest. Halliday v.
United States, 380 F.2d 270 (1 Cir. 1967). This was a § 2255 proceeding which
challenged the voluntariness of pleas of guilty originally accepted without appropriate
inquiry under criminal Rule 11. The First Circuit held that it was not
proper for the same district judge tQ take new evidence and review the correctness
of his own determination. Chief Judge Aldrich recognized that there are
cases which look the other way. He stated that the court reached Its conclusion,
not from any feeling of constitutional compulsion, "but from a conviction that
the best practice dictates such a policy". He observed that this did not mean that
a sentencing judge cannot review a § 2255 petition to conclude, if appropriate,
that no evidentiary hearing is required. He recognized that the ruling could
entail complications in a one judge district. One can also envision complications
if 0,! e" e -s to h- followed in a multiple judge district.
IV. Section 753(f).
Judge Heaney has suggested that a comment about cost-free transcripts would
be in order. Here two statutes are pertinent. The first is § 1915(b), mentioned
above, which provides that in any civil or criminal case the court may "direct
that the expense of printing the record on appeal, if such printing is required
by the appellate court, be paid by the United States". This, of course, seems to
relate to printing as such, but often printing the record first requires a typed
transcript of oral testimony. The second is the Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C.
§ 753(f). As last amended in 1965, this provides in part:
28 U.S.C. § 753. Reporters
* * * * * * *
(f) * * * Fees for transcrips furnished in criminal or habeas corpus
proceedings to persons allowed to sue, defend, or appeal in forma pauperis
shall be paid by the United States out of money appropriated for that purpose.
Fees for transcripts furnished in proceedings brought under section
2255 of this title to persons permitted to sue or appeal in forma pauperls
shall be paid by the United States out of money appropriated for that purpose
if the trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the suit or appeal
is not frivolous and that the transcript is needed to decide the issue presented
by the suit or appeal. Fees for transcripts furnished in other proceedings
to persons permitted to appeal in forma pauperis shall also be paid by the
United States if the trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the appeal
is not frivolous (but presents a substantial question). * * *
Section 753(f ) obviously separates the cases into three categories:
1. Criminal or habeas corpus proceedings.
2. Section 2255 proceedings.
3. Other proceedings.
As to criminal or habeas corpus proceedings the statute merely says that
transcript fees shall be paid by the United States out of money appropriated for
that purpose. No condition is imposed.
For a § 2255 proceeding a fee for a transcript shall be paid by the United
States only on condition. That condition is that the trial judge or a circuit
judge certify both that the suit or appeal is not frivolous and that the transcript
is needed for decision. Here we need a certification of no frivolity and of necessity.
This smacks partially of § 1915(d)'s reference to frivolity but does not
seem to relate to the good faith of § 1915(a), or to the probable cause of § 2253.
Perhaps the statute is clear enough.
For "other proceedings" a transcript fee shall be paid by the United States
again only on condition. This time the condition is that the appeal is not frivolous
but presents a substantial question and, for what significance, if any, it
may have, the latter phrase is in parentheses.
Thus, to repeat, for § 2255, we need a certificate as to non-frivolity and necessity.
For "other proceedings" we need a certificate as to non-frivolity and,
parenthetically, as to substantialness. Why do we have these distinctions in the
statute? Are they merely careless draftsmanship, or the product, so often confusing,
of amendment or compromise during the legislative process, or are the
differences intentional and of significance?
One sidelight is perhaps of interest. Section 753(f) was amended in 1965
in order to provide cost-free transcripts for use in § 2255 proceedings. Prior
thereto, such transcripts were not authorized. Mr. Ramsey Clark, then Deputy
Attorney General, wrote the Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary
on May 27, 1965, recommending the amendment. He suggested that the Committee
give consideration to the fact that, in a habeas corpus matter, there is no
requirement for certification that the proceeding is not frivolous and the transcript
is needed. He said, "The reason for this distinction is not apparent if the
motion remedy under section 2255 is to be a remedy commensurate with a writ of
habeas corpus". 2 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News, 89th Cong., 1 sess. 1965, pp.
2920-2921. The Committee apparently did not give much consideration to the
distinction.
In one district court civil case the judge observed that he had no difficulty in
determining that the appeal was not frivolous but that he did have difficulty in
determining whether it presented a substantial question. He then related substance
to something "reasonably debatable" on a purely objective standard.
Ortiz v. Greyhound Corp., 192 F. Supp. 903, 905 (D. Md. 1959). Actually, he conditioned
his relief by requiring that the expense to the government be taxed as
costs in the case and ultimately recovered from the party found to be liable. This
condition, as a practical matter, probably did not work out for the defendant
ultimately prevailed on a judgment n.o.v. Ortiz v. Greyhound Corp., 275 F. 2d
770 (4 Cir 1960).
Of possible significance is the Fourth Circuit's decision in United States v.
Shoaf, 341 F. 2d 832 (4 Cir. 1964), issued prior to the 1965 amendment of § 753(f).
This was a § 2255 proceeding where the petitioner requested free transcripts of
two trials. Judge Haynsworth observed that "the right to a transcript at government
expense arises only in response to need of it"; that need on a direct appeal
with new appellate counsel is a situation different from collateral attack where
"most of the trial errors warranting attention in direct appeals are not reviewable";
that it is rare where the defendant needs a transcript "to become aware
of the events or occurrences which constitute a ground for collateral attack";
and that the Supreme Court has not yet gone so far as to require the furnishing
of a transcript to a § 2255 indigent applicant "who has undertaken to show neither
specific nor general need" for it.
A special question, and this is the one Judge Heaney is interested in, is whether
a court has the power to order a transcript at government expense before it allows
an appeal in forma pauperis.
The cases are few. Whitt v. United States, 104 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 259 F. 2d 158
(1958), cert. denied 359 U.S. 937, 79 S. Ct. 652, 3 L. Ed. 2d 637, concerned a direct
criminal appeal. Judge Washington, in writing for the court, held that § 753(f)
gives the trial court and the court of appeals authority to direct the preparation
of a transcript at government expense prior to the allowance of in forma pauperis
appellate relief. He went on to observe, however, that a petitioner is not entitled
to a transcript as of right. Judges Fahy and Bazelon, who sat with him, in concurrence
added that the ordering of a transcript at government expense "is an
essential incident to our power to allow appeals in forma pauperis". This meant,
I suppose, that they felt they did not have to be concerned with § 753(f).
As noted, Whitt was a direct appeal. Its holding, applicable to such an appeal
and to a habeas matter, may seem clear enough under § 753(f). But what of a
§ 2255 proceeding? Whitt, as to this, is not strictly in point for it rests on that
part of § 753(f) which is not conditioned by non-frivolity and necessity. Can
frivolity and necessity usually be determined by the very nature of the issues
raised so that a transcript is not necessary, within the reqirement of the statute?
And if a judge certifies that an appeal is not frivolous in order to get a transcript,
is he thereby determining non-frivolity for all purposes, that is, for purposes of
allowing the in forma pauperis § 2255 appeal which,you recall, relates back to
§ 1915 and its standard of good faith? Judge Learned Hand noted this dilemma
when he said, "We are of course aware that a thorough decision whether there
was a substantial question would depend upon a scrutiny of the whole record;
so that, speaking literally, we could not adequately decide the motion until after
we had granted it." Jaffe v. United States, 246 F. 2d 760, 762 (2 Cir. 1957).
Here, again, I suggest that this dilemma in most cases may prove to be more
apparent than real and that often frivolity and necessity can and will be determined
to exist or to be absent by the inherent nature of the issues raised, rather
than by a review of the contents of the transcript. This is not to say, of course,
that, once the appeal has been allowed, a transcript may not be needed for purposes
of appellate review.
All this may be hairsplitting. Certainly, I personally incline toward the view
that a court does have power to order transcript fees paid in appropriate
situations.
Now, some personal observations, some by way of apology, some with conviction:
1. The law in this area is still developing. Some aspects of the reach and of
the limitations of the statutes are yet to be determined.
2. Some of the older cases, on both the trial and appellate levels, are perhaps
of questionable precedent today and should be employed gingerly and with
caution.
3. All through this area-in the statutes themselves, as you have seen, and
cer'ainly in the published opinions-are words which seem to be phrases of art.
"Probable cause," "good faith," and "frivolous," are the primary ones. Do these
have like or significantly different meanings and do they imply the presence of like
or different standards for judicial action? Certainly, all of them are used with
respect to issues which are fundamentally similar.
4. We must appreciate the practical aspects. Judicial attitudes change. Court
personnel changes. We progress, we hope, in legal and even in constitutional
interpretation. As in medicine, with which I am somewhat familiar, so in law,
although more slowly, there is constant movement. We should be aware of this,
anticipate it, and not resent it. We would not wish the situation to be otherwise.
5. I have worked into all this a good bit of my own attitude and my own approach.
My judgment may be good but it also may be very bad. Certainly, yours
is just as reliable as mine.
However, and for what they are worth, I end this overlong presentation with
a series of conclusions, which I submit to you for your consideration:
CONCLUSIONS
1. Our primary and initial concern is not with § 2253 or with § 2255 but with
the in forma pauperis statute § 1915. This is the statute which sets the tone.
2. Section 1915 is broad and comprehensive in terms and in application. It is
not restricted to criminal matters or to habeas or to § 2255 proceedings
3. The concept that in forma pauperis procedure is a privilege, rather than a
right, is perhaps somewhat suspect today, despite continuing lip service to it.
In one sense, it may be a privilege, but the sovereign has chosen to grant it and it
thereby assumes certain characteristics of a right.
4. Still, the procedure at least on the statute's face, is within the area of discretion.
A federal court "may authorize" the procedure.
5. In a direct appeal from a criminal conviction the indigent is to have the
same rights of review possessed by the non-indigent. This means counsel who is
an advocate. This means only an issue which is not plainly frivolous. This means
only an argument which is rational. This does not mean any particular degree
of probability of success.
6. On a direct appeal from a criminal conviction there remains only a very
little elbow room, despite the good faith requirement of § 1915 (a), for denial of
in forma pauperis appellate procedure. This is a practical fact which, as practical
judges, we must recognize. Concededly, the Eighth Circuit has not indulged in
the practice of specially screening non-indigent appeals from convictions in order
to ascertain frivolity prior to full hearing on the merits. It follows that it is not
permissible to do this on indigent appeals.
7. Whether, in a civil case, the in forma pauperis standards for direct criminal
appeals are to apply is as yet unsettled. The Supreme Court has not spoken. There
is authority that the standards are fully applicable in civil cases. There is authority,
where specific relief is requested, that there are limitations. The trend,
I suspect, is toward full application. I also suspect, however, that complete justice
can be effected on a case-by-case approach.
8. If, in a state prisoner's federal habeas corpus proceeding, a district judge
grants a certificate of probable cause, the court of appeals must review "with its
ordinary procedure." Nowakowski.
9. No uniformly accepted definition of probable cause has as yet evolved. A
standard higher than "good faith" seems to be implied. Some decisions, in denying
relief, speak of frivolity. This apparent difference, however, is not important and
it is understandable. If a case is frivolous, it certainly lacks probable cause. It
seems reasonalble to conclude that the standard of § 2253 demands something of
possible substance before the applicant is legally entitled to his certificate.
10. This being so, a district judge should not routinely issue the certificate in
every case. His is the first and primary decision to be made. The right of appeal
has been known to be abused. If he feels that no probable cause exists, it is his
responsibility and his duty to deny the certificate.
11. The appelate judge has corresponding responsibility not routinely to issue
the certificate in every case, even though, when issued, the appeal may still be
dismissed for frivolity under civil Rule 75(g) or perhaps under § 1915(d).
12. In a § 2255 appeal in forma pauperis, the applicable standard is that
inherent in § 1915, namely, "good faith". This may be a standard lower than probable
cause. But, as a practical matter, is it?
13. A judge, district or appellate, does have the power to order a transcript,
or a partial one, at government expense, not only after an appeal has been
allowed, but also before such allowance in order to enable him to pass upon the
existence of grounds for appeal, specified by the statute, for the particular type
of proceeding.
14. A judge, however, should exercise this power realistically and not incur this
expense for the government if he can determine the satisfaction or non-satisfaction
of the statutory standard from another source as, for example the motion
papers themselves.
15. Let us, in this entire area, until the Supreme Court instructs us otherwise,
be willing to act as responsible judges, to evaluate each case, and to make a
considered judgment. If we are reversed occasionally, what does it matter?
Our professional satisfaction lies in a job performed responsibly and not in
avoiding responsibility.
