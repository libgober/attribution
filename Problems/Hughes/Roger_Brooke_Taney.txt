tulate of the Constitution, he found in it nothing in
derogation of the dignity of sovereign States which
on the con
had entered the compact of the Union;
trary, he said, "the highest honor of sovereignty is un
tarnished faith." In this eloquent and uncompromising
utterance, upholding the authority of the Court at a
time of extreme passion and agitation, Chief Justice
Taney discharged unflinchingly the supreme duty of
his office.
In this hour of tribute by those who prize the
happy traditions of this community, I can do no bet
ter than to recall the appraisal of an associate of the
Chief Justice who in the peculiar intimacy of the la
bors of the Court knew the quality of Taney's work
better than others, whether friends or critics. I quote,
not the words of a political supporter, but the esti
mate of Justice Benjamin R. Curtis of Massachu
setts, one of the ablest men who has sat upon the
Bench, and one who had strongly dissented from the
decision of the Chief Justice in the case of Dred Scott.
Said Justice Curtis in his remarks on the death of

all that peculiar jurisprudence which it is the special
States to ad
province of the courts of the United
minister and apply. His
skill in applying it was of
the highest order. His power of subtle analysis ex
ceeded that of any man I ever knew; a power not
without its dangers to a judge as well as to a lawyer;
but in this case, it was balanced and checked by ex
cellent common sense and by great experience in prac
tical business, both public and private. . . . For it is
certainly true, and I am happy to be able to bear
direct testimony to it, that the surpassing ability of
the chief justice, and all his great qualities of char
acter and mind, were more fully and constantly ex
hibited in the consultation-room, while presiding over
and assisting the deliberation of his brethren, than the

public knew, or can ever justly appreciate.
his dignity, his love of order, his gentleness, his cau
tion, his accuracy, his discrimination were of incal
culable importance. The real intrinsic character of the
tribunal was greatly influenced by them, and always
for the better. . . . He was as absolutely free from
the slightest trace of vanity and self-conceit as any
man I ever knew. . . . The preservation of the har
mony of the members of the court, and of their good
will to himself, was always in his mind."
With
the passing of the years, and the softening
of old asperities, the arduous service nobly rendered
by Roger Brooke Taney has received its fitting recog
nition. He bore his wounds with the fortitude of an
invincible spirit. He was a great Chief Justice.
