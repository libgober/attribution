His topic was &quot;What Legal  Aid Means to America&#39;s Poor.&quot; · He sketched  the history  of  legal aid  work  in this  country and  de­ scribed  the  kind  of   service  that  is  rendered to persons  too poor  lo employ  lawyers  on  the  ordi­ nary  basis.  He  pointed  out   that   the need  of legal  aid  to  the  i:ioor  is  not   nearly as widely understood as that  of  medical   and  surgical  aid. The social necessity  that  no  one must be deprived of the latter, because of  poverty. is so generally recognized that,  comparatively  speaking, the well­ to-rlo  contribute generously to hospitals; and pub­ lic   funds are readily reached to provide hos­ pitalization,  clinical  care  and  expert  meclical   ad­</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">\&#39;ice  to  the  extent  that  private philanthropy  docs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">not meet the need. <span class="s10">In </span>reality the provision of needed legal assistancP. to the poor is in  many ways just as vital  a social necessity.

But public  understanding  of  this fact  is still in  its elementary  stage.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">That brings me to the subject of my own talk,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Meeting the Need for  Legal  Aid  to  the  Poor.&quot; The ideal that rich and poor shall stand on  an equality  before  the  law  means  something   more than the assurance won in  Magna  Carta  in  1215, &quot;to no one will we  sell, to  no  one  will  we  refuse or delay right or justice,&quot; revolutionary as that advance  was  in  that  day.   <span class="s9">It </span>means   something more  than  that  courts  should  be   impartial   and not  consciously  prefer  the  cause   of   the   strong and  influential  over  that  of   the  weak  and  friencl­ les!. Courts  must  act  on  the  facts  presented   to them;   they   cannot   develop  those  facts on   their own  motion  unaided.  This  is  in  most   cases  the function  of  lawyers,  whose  services  are  an  abso­ lutely  essential   factor   in   the   administration    of justice.      Equality   before   the law therefore  re­ quires  that  the  poor  have  both  advice  as  to  their rights   and   representation   of   their   just   causes   in the   courts,   which   <span class="s15">is   </span>both   devoted    <span class="s15">and    </span>skillful. And   meeting   the  neerl for legal aid  to  the  poor there fore  come;,   down  to  bringing  l.o   the  poor the services of  honest  and  competent.  lawyers.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">The  existing  means  of  meeting  this  necrl  arc.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">first, conscientious  private  lawyers;  second,  legal aid  societies.  bureaus  and  offices.  sumc  private and    some   pul1licly    supported;    <span class="s13">and,   </span>third,   en­ lightened lrgislatiou, u;;uall &#39;  !&lt;ponsorrrl  by   legal aid sorirt ies or  <span class="s15">h:1 </span>r  ;1s;;ociat it&gt;ns.  to   eliminate practices wl1icli bear  ha r:;hly  un  the  poor, or to simplify the machinery of justice  in  certain  kinds of   cases  with  which   they  are  chiefly  concerned.

We  need not dwell on the third ·category, social  legislation,  because, while  reforms  like  workmen&#39;s  compensation  and the   establishment   of small  claims  courts  may dispense with  the  need of  lawyers in some cases, there still remain  so many in which legal services arc essential to   justice   that   the   obligation   to bring  them  within reach of the poor is still, and always  will  be,  a pressing  one.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;">The amount that the private lawyer, like the private doctor, can do, important  as it is, has inherent  limitations.  This  is  especially  true  in the cities. The country lawyer, like the country doctor, is a friend and father confessor to  the entire neighborhood. He knows  everyone and everyone knows him. He lakes care of  the rich, the comfortably-off and the poor alike and charges them according  lo  their  means;  the  very  poor not at all. Since he knows, or knows about, everybody,  the  country   lawyer   can   without   dif­ ficulty distinguish the deserving from the  unde­ serving, the man  with  a  just  grievance  from  the crank,  and  give  each  the  attention  which  he  de­ serves.  This  is  legal  aid  in  its  best  form.  <span class="s10">It </span>docs not  need  to  be  organized.    The  lawyers  of the small  community  are their  own legal  aid  so­ ciety, just  as the doctors of   that  community  are the  only necessary  clinic.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Needs  <span class="p">of  </span>Large  <span class="p">City</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: right;">At   the   other   extreme   are   the   crowded    and complicaterl   conditions   of   life   in   a   metropolis. The indivirlual  Jnwyer, conscientious  as he  may be, is no  more able to  meet  on  any  consirlerablc  scale the  need   for  legal  aid   to  the  poor  than   is  the print e  physician   or   surgeon   to   meet   the   need for  medical  and  surgical  aid  or  the  generous  phil­ anthropist   to  dispense  charity  directly.    The  poor arc  comparatively   more   numerous.    They  are not in   any   physical   sense   neighbors   of   those   who would   aid   them.     The   individual    practitioner, legal  or  medical,  is  not  in  contact  with  those who need   legal  or  medical  service,  nor  are  they  with him.    The  inclividual  lawyer  cannot,  without  very searching    and   time-taking    investigation,    distin­ guish   between   the  worthy   and   the  unworthy  ap­ plicant   or  oftrn  e\·en  hrtw(&#39;rn   the  &lt;:rne  and  the insane.

And  so  it  results  that</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">in the larger cities the  conscientious  private lawyer, while  still  giving  a  considerable  amount of free legal service direct  to persons with whom the normal relations of his  life  happen  to  bring him  in  contact,  discharges  his  part  of  the  obliga­ tion  to  bring  legal  aid  to  the  poor  in  the mass largely by contributing generously to a  legal aid society.  Between   rural   conditions   at   the   one extreme  and  those  of   a  great  metropolis  at  the other,  the  need   for  organization  of  legal  aid  in­ creases  directly   with the population; but it is safe to say that  organization is necessary to some extent in urban  communities  of  any considerable size.    There   now exist about  a  hundred  such organizations,  great  or  small.  Their  growth  has been   encouraging.  <span class="s9">In </span>1920, when  the  legal  aid idea  was already over forty years old, the  legal aid   offices  of  the  country  aided   some  96,000 clients; in 1936 the number  was  over  260,000. But in a number of cities these offices are of comparatively recent  origin  and  small  in  the scope  of   their  service.    And  even  in   communi­ ties where they are relatively well  established, the dependability  of   resources  to  meet  their  hudgets varies  greatly.    <span class="s9">In </span>some  places the private legal aid society shares in the  community  chest  with family  relief,   children&#39;s   aid, hospitals and the other  vitally  essential  agencies of social service; but in many others  it  does not.   There  are  still many  large  and   important  cities  where  there  <span class="s13">is </span>no  such  agency  at all. Seattle, Toledo, Birming­ ham, Richmond   and Syracuse are glaring exam­ ples of  large  cities where none exist. The estab­ lishment of   legal aid societies has been mainly due  to  the  efforts of public-spirited lawyers  and laymen  in  their own communities,  and  there  has therefore  been no logical planning of where they should be  put. For instance, Springfield and ;\cw Bedford,  Mass., and Reading. Pa .. have legal aid societies,   while the  comparable  cities  of  Wor­ cester,  Mass., and  Scranton, Pa., ha.\&quot;C  not.   The fact  that a legal aid  soc.iety  exists  in  a  certain city  also by no means tells the whole story.   The oldest of all· is that of New York City. but its resources  do  not  permit  it  to  serve  the  whole of  Greater  &#39;.\&#39;ew  York.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Revenue  Never  Suffices</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;">It <span class="p">is unquestionably the fact thal. no pri\·atcly financrd legal aid society has now the resources. either in money or man-µower, to  meet  anything like th.; neecl for legal scrvicr in the  community which   it   t ri1&#39;s  to  serve.

This is especially serious where the  pros­ pective   client  is  the   defendant  to   whom even victory would not mean a recovery  out of which he might pay a competent private  lawyer.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">The inability of private resources fully  to meet the need for legal aid  has  in  some  communities led to the establishment of public offices. The obligation of society to provide a lawyer for  a poor person accused of crime has  won  more general recognition than its obligation to provide lawyers for the  poor  in  civil  relations.  This  is the   so-called   &quot;public   defender&quot;   plan.     Neverthe­ less, some of the  civil  legal aid  agencies, for ex­ ample, those in S·t. Louis and  Hartford, are  pub­ licly supported;  and  in  one   city the civil work is public while the criminal   work  is  privately handled.  While  public   legal   aid agencies may appear to be blessed  with  greater financial stabil­ ity, they too have their   troubles.    In  times  of financial depression  usually the first items cut out of  public  budgets   arc  those  for  facilities   that, rightly  or  wrongly   are regarded as experimental or  at  least  new.     Legal aid in  Philadelphia  had that experience.    There had been an excellent pri­ vate legal aid   society.  Because  its  resources were  limited,  it   was  not  able  to  fill  the  needs of  the   community;   and  the  city  took   over   the work   on a much larger  budget.  But  when  the depression deepened that item was cut out. of the appropriation bill and the public legal aid bureau closed its doors.  There  was  nothing  to  do  then but revive the  old  private  society.  Public  legal aid bureaus and public defenders&#39; offices in other cities have suffered similar  fates.  The  result  is that legal aid work. whether privately or publicly financed,  is  under-developed.     Many   cities  that</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">neerl  it  have  not  get  it  at  all.    <span class="s9">In </span>cities  where</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">it exists its resources  arc  generally  inadequate to do the needed  task.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Society&#39;s  Obligation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">There is unly one rcniedy for all of this, an awakened public conscience. There is need  for more general appreciation  of  the  obligation  on the part of  lawyers  themselves.  State  and  local bar associations could do more than they are doing to  promote  systematic  extension  of  legal  aid  or­ ganizations.     But  there  is  e\·en  greater   need of recognition  on  the  part  of  the  public   that so­ ciety&#39;s obligation  to  insure  equality   before the law  can  no  more  be  adequately   handled by the legal profession alone than can   society&#39;s obliga­ tion to provide medical and   surgical service be handled by the medical  profession  alone.    Private contributions   to   support  legal  aid  should  be  as</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 116%;text-align: justify;">readily  accessible  as  are  those  lo  support   hos­ pitals;   and  public  opinion   should   demand  that publicly  supported legal aid  bureaus, once estab­ lished, should not be  lightly abandoned.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">To the uninitiated, legal aid, especially in civil matters, lacks something of the dramatic appeal. But to those \\&#39;ho know it, its deep significance is evident. The servant girl or working man in financial distress striving to recover wages justly due; the woman distracted by marital or other family problems; the  victim  of  the  loan  shark or other oppressor struggling to extricate himself from  a  morass-all  of  these  and  many  others in like plight flock to the doors of a legal aid society.   To them  it is a haven  of  reftige.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">All cannot be helped, but tens  of  thousands are.

To  all  is   brought the deep spiritual satisfaction  of   vindicated right, if their causes have been   successful, and, even if not, of having had a  patient hearing, expert and disinterested advice  and a thorough  and  skillful representation of  their causes in the courts.
